# Members Only Project

This project is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com).

## Description

The Members Only project is a Ruby on Rails application where authenticated users can create posts, but only authenticated users can see who authored the posts. Essentially, it's a simple version of a social media platform where the authorship of posts is only visible to logged-in users.

## Features

- Authentication system for users to sign up, log in, and log out.
- Users can create posts.
- Posts are displayed with the author's name only to logged-in users.
- Non-logged-in users can see posts but not the authors.

## Usage

- Sign up for a new account or log in with an existing one.
- Create new posts by clicking on the "New Post" link.
- View posts on the homepage. If logged in, you'll see the author's name alongside each post.
